Cringe Pack
Current Version- Unreleased


At this time, this pack is not complete.

To install, download the master branch. Unzip the file you get and then drag that folder into your resourcepack folder in you .minecraft folder. If the resource pack doesn't show up, make sure that you don't have a folder inside of a folder. That causes the resource pack to not be read.
